### TradeCLI 1.0

This is a small scale cli trader. I would like to pivot its development in version 2.0 that will allow for model development. It will create learning models to build off of, and to support simple and programmable trading strategies.

This program runs off of main.py and I have tried my best to link everything accordingly. In version 3.0 I will add an installer for useability. I will provide a small detailed report of all the code sublets with each cli command created. 

The only small problem is the API features. I build them explicitly the way they are. This might allow you to import them as enviorment variables, or create a helper function like getKeys from the code. 

I hope you keep an eye on this project, and follow for more update!
